            <h1>Dear Michelle</h1>
            <p>My heart, my love, my princess, my queen, the girl of my dreams,</p>
            <p>I want you to know how much I miss you and how proud I am of you. I will always love you. We had so many beautiful times together, and even though there were difficult moments, we were just kids trying to learn and grow in love. Please don’t act so brand new just because we’re not together. I understand you’re trying to move on, and that’s okay. I know I messed up, and we both did. I’m always willing to make amends because we are too young to not let our emotions flow freely.</p>
            <p>This isn’t meant to make you love me again or to be in a relationship. I just wanted to express how much I miss and love you. Maybe one day we can be together again.</p>
            <p>I love you bubble, till infinity x a lifetime.</p>
